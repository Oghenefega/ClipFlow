## DONE (machine-verified, awaiting Fega's hands-on) — #164 polish round 2 (session 105)

Fega's four items from his alpha.3 pass, all shipped in **0.1.9-alpha.4**:
1. ✅ Shadow edge option removed (Fade is the only edge treatment; stored
   "shadow" values resolve to fade; migration cleans library entries).
2. ✅ Background no longer stuck on the floor: new default = 2× zoom centered
   on the game box (`bgZoom 50 → 2.0×`, `bgPosX/bgPosY 50/50`).
3. ✅ New controls: Zoom slider (0–100 → 1×–3×) + drag the Result preview to
   reposition the background (content-follows-pointer, clamped, live).
4. ✅ Named layouts: "Save layout" opens a name field (prefilled); "Saved
   layouts" list in the panel (apply on click, ★ default toggle, dimmed rows
   on dimension mismatch, "In use" tag); re-save updates in place (duplicate
   bug fixed by writing layoutId back onto the project after first save).

### Implementation (delegated to 2 Sonnet subagents, reviewed line-by-line)
- All window math in `reframeStyle.js` (`bgSourceWindow`) — parity by
  construction; engines just consume the integer window.
- `render.js` bg chain: `crop=<win>,scale=270:480,…` replaces the
  cover+center-crop pair; shadow branch deleted.
- `PreviewPanelNew.js`: scratch draws the same window; shadow branch deleted.
- `RightPanelNew.js`: chips out, Zoom slider in, Result drag (pointer capture,
  buttons-guard, pointercancel), save row, `SavedLayoutsList`.
- `useEditorStore.js`: `saveReframeLayout(name)` (upsert + link-back +
  default-only-if-none), `applyReframeLayout(entry)` (dims guard).
- `main.js`: layout-library migration re-resolves style (adds bg fields,
  drops seam) — idempotent, fresh-install no-op.

### Verification evidence (session 105)
- `bgSourceWindow` node checks: zoom 0 == old cover framing EXACTLY
  ({470,0,1620,2880} on the 2560×2880 canvas); default = centered half;
  clamps + even-rounding hold on degenerate rects.
- Filter args: no-reframe path has zero `rf_` tokens (byte-identical);
  default style → `crop=810:1440:875:720`; blur=0/darken=0 stages drop;
  zero shadow tokens.
- CDP drive (dev app, proj_polish_real): 22/22 v3 + drag proven in v2
  (pointer counts, pos 36/29 in drag direction, fling clamps safe), zero
  renderer exceptions across all runs. Library migration verified live
  (dev entry gained bg fields, lost seam, kept blur/darken).
- Real render (`RL 2026-07-15.mp4` clone): FFmpeg args contained the
  hand-computed `crop=272:482:838:1713`; frame grab shows correct composite
  (bands + feather + chosen bg region + subtitles).
- Driver gotchas for the record: editor top bar has its own "Save" button —
  scope clicks to the inline row; the Result box needs `scrollIntoView`
  before CDP pointer events land; the timeline zoom slider is a 5th
  `[role=slider]` — scope slider asserts to the panel.

### Fega's verification pass (0.1.9-alpha.4)
- Background sits on the action by default; Zoom slider + dragging the small
  Result preview reposition it.
- Shadow chip gone.
- Saving asks for a name; list picks/applies; ★ moves the default.

### Deferred / parked (carried)
- First-recording auto-offer slice (approved, session 103), Projects-tab
  preview consistency, Phase B (MediaPipe pre-fill), #165 zoom tuning,
  #163 YouTube reconnect messaging, old waveform cache cleanup, session-102
  waveform regression check.
