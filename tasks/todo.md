## ACTIVE PLAN

_None._ Session 74 ran the triage's fix-first batch (5 fixes, see SHIPPED). Next: #87
(segment clamp), the #68→#62 pipeline pair (Part A relocate first), or the karaoke
fragile zone (`tasks/backlog-triage.md` Section C). Run the start-session ritual.

---

## SHIPPED — recent (closed)
- **Session 74 fix-first batch** (all closed `status: untested`): **#124** waveform/ffmpeg logs → `app.log` (`759e7a2`); **#92** "Applied" badge gated on confirmed save (`1fc5964`); **#101** punctuationRemove restored on reopen, **#32** caption-width restored on reopen, **#106** passive-wheel console warning killed across 3 handlers (`a197bc3`). Parked #68/#62; recorded the `tools/`-bundling scope correction on #68.
- **#57** Editor 30-min lag (60fps re-render storm) — **CLOSED** (D1 `c74c30e` timeline + D2 `985fa12` subtitle list). Both per-frame storms isolated into tiny memoized children (`TimelinePlayhead`, `SegmentRow`); Fega-confirmed smooth. Phase D3 (row self-subscribes to `currentTime` so the parent can drop its sub) was the conditional fallback — not needed.
- **#129** ALL-CAPS (AA) no-op on uncased text — fixed (`507347a`, session 72). Surfaced by the D2 fresh-eyes review.
- **#130** Stale "Long segment" warning after timecode/split/merge — fixed (`507347a`, session 72). Surfaced by the D2 fresh-eyes review.
- **#125** Recordings (i) info popover + Play-recording-in-editor — closed (`1d33a9d`, session 70).
- **#126** Recordings sort by part number, not rename-click time — shipped (`f2240e2`, session 70).
- **#123** Recordings floating action cluster + sequential batch generate — closed (`e9a039d`, session 68).

## Deferred plans

### Subtitle highlight bugs surfaced by the #57 D2 review (filed, not started)
Both touch the historically-fragile highlight logic (Phase B/C revert class) — fix in focused
sessions with full highlight verification on a GENERATED clip:
- **#131** Karaoke + word-click seek desync when a clip trim drops words from a surviving segment
  (`words[]` filtered, `text` stays full → two index spaces). Fix: carry each surviving word's
  original pre-filter index (`srcWordIdx`) through `visibleWords`/`getActiveWordInSeg`/`handleWordClick`.
- **#132** Clicking a subtitle word during playback freezes the karaoke highlight until the next
  pause/play (the play-clear effect only fires on the false→true `playing` transition). Fix: also
  clear the selection once `adjustedTime` advances past the selected word while playing.

### #85 Chunk B/D — title/caption clip-signal forwarding (was active session 45)
Plan to forward `energyLevel` + `confidence` into the title/caption prompt
(`useAIStore._collectClipParams` → `title-caption-prompt.js buildUserContent` →
`main.js anthropic:generate`). Chunk D (wire full `creatorProfile`) is
**deliberately deferred** — profile is detection-only by design; feeding
`archetype` into wording re-introduces the generic template-y copy session 42
removed. Full body recoverable from `git log -p tasks/todo.md`. Re-introduce when
returning to #85.

### Interactive architecture/flows visualizer
A previous session drafted a single-page HTML architecture visualizer for the
Obsidian vault (`context/architecture/`) using vis-network 9.x. Never approved or
started. Body recoverable from git history. Re-introduce when there's appetite for
a docs-quality artifact.
